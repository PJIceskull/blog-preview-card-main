## Overview

This challenge is a perfect project for getting up to speed with HTML and CSS fundamentals, like HTML structure and the box model. The challenge is to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. In this project, I want to try new sass values for my styles.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS

### Planning

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
